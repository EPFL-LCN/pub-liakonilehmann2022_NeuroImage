Some naming conventions in the code are slightly different than the one used in the paper.
We chose not to change them to avoid the introduction of errors and keep the code "as is".

More specifically:

- surprise trials = catch trials = jumps
- graph 2 = G3 = graph 3

- Surprise Actor-critic = actorCriticTD_modulatedActor = ActorCriticModulated = actor_critic_TD_modulatedActor_1degree
- Surprise REINFORCE = REINFORCE_modulated
- Hybrid Actor-Critic PF = hybrid_actorcritic_FWD_BF
- Surprise Sarsa-λ = sarsaL_modulated
- Hybrid-λ (Daw et al. 2011) = hybridSarsaL = hybrid_FWD_SarsaLambda
- Hybrid-0 (Glaescher et al. 2010) = glaescherHybrid = glaescher_hybrid
- Hybrid Actor-Critic = hybrid_actorcritic_FWD
- Hybrid-λ-PS-PF = hybrid_pspf_sarsaL = Hybrid_Prio_Sweep_TParticleFilterJump
